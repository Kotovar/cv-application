## How to use

To use CV-Application, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can clone this repository and run the following commands:

`npm install` to install all dependencies

`npm run dev` to start the development server

open `http://localhost:[path]` in your browser

## How it works

To create this application I used the following technologies:

- React + JSX + JavaScript
- SASS
- Vite

---

This constructor allows you to specify basic information, information about work, education, skills and additional information in free form. You can upload your own photo. To export in pdf format, the built-in browser properties and @media print settings are used. Use localStorage to store entered data.
